    <h1>About The Site</h1>
    To be honest i'm not sure what exactly will go on this site. However, if I had to make an educated guess, im going to say it will be all of the work that I will be completing throughout the course. That being said, I hope you enjoy the site, and don't find anything to troubling or hard to access.
